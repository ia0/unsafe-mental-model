# Glossary

- [anonymous type][anonymous]: A type built from its interpretation, thus without syntax.
- [associated proof][unsafe-traits]: An associated constant of the proof type.
- [bottom type][validity]: The type with an empty interpretation.
- [permissions to use][properties]: Characteristic of a robust type.
- [restrictions to use][properties]: Characteristic of an unsafe type.
- [robust type][properties]: An anonymous type missing some safe values.
- [safe type][properties]: A Rust type (its interpretation is exactly the safe values).
- [safe value][validity]: A value satisfying the safety invariant.
- [soundness][type-systems]: The property of type systems that only accept defined programs.
- [subtyping][subtyping]: The inclusion relation between type interpretations.
- [type interpretation][types]: A mapping from types to their set of values.
- [unsafe type][properties]: An anonymous type containing some unsafe values.
- [unsafe value][validity]: A valid but not safe value.
- [valid value][validity]: A value satisfying the validity invariant.
- [value][types]: A part of the execution of a program.
- [variance][variance]: Type-level functions behavior regarding subtyping.
